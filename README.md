# Speedy CSS 
*This is a tailwind clone as a proof of understanding I intend to generate the general css code that is commonly used as individual classes*

## Reasoning?
I'm trying to learn and the best way to learn is to do. This project is to see if I can create a clone that can do a majority of what tailwind-css can do while keeping the project lightweight and simple... in a word speedy.

## What are my goals?
This project will be a success if I can create a website without having to touch css. The expectation is that the blocks will be well spaced and nice to navigate. A theme color will be selected, and should be easily swapped for dark mode. Below is the general outline of the dummy site:

- header
    - main navigation
    - image logo that is properly sized
- content
    - hero image
    - content block
    - inline image
    - table
- footer
    - three columns
        - logo again
        - link bank verticle
        - list of social
- copyright
    - fullwidth container with centered text.
